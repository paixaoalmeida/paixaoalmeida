Currently studying programming every day to get to a professional level. Im improving really fast and getting better and better, learning about Python, SQL and GIT at the same. (I like to play with the back-end, but interested in the front-end as well)
</div>
<br>

I'd like to get into a internship to show my skills and how good I'm in this field (Mean it, i have a lot of good times when im programming)

You see, every one says they are good, but i really get feedback every day of people telling me i should try to program professionally, i have a lot of knowledge on the basics and i know how to connect everything very well with ease.

<i>I really would like to make a difference at people's lives, i guess that's what coders do, they solve problems and improve other people's lives, i mean, i like to do that, a lot.</i>

<strong>If you think I'm worth it, reach me out, to learn all the stuff i need to, I'm really willing to work in your company to get to a professional level, and my dear friend, I'm a guy who values partnerships, i will be grateful for a long time and for sure we will go to some places together, inst that awesome?</strong>
